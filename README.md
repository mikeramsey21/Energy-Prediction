# Energy-Prediction
I create various models to predict energy consumption for 50 U.S. cities based on temperature and other predictors.

I was given two years of monthly weather and energy usage data for 50 U.S. cities. The overall goal was to create a model to predict monthly energy usage based on temperature, and then use this model to predict the energy consumption for "Denver", given a third year of temperature data. 

## Folders
Data: The data used for the project.
Figures: Various visualizations of the data.
Final_Report: My final report of the analysis.
Prediction: My energy usage prediction for the third year of denver.
Presentation: A brief slide-presentation on my chosen model.

## Files
Final.R: Visualization of data and construct various models based only on temperature
Final_Reg.R: Added a "region" predictor to the model constructed in Final
Final_Reg_Pop.R: Added "region" and "population" predictors to the model
